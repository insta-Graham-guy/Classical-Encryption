# Classical-Encryption
Examples of classical encryption techniques.  These are not good for practical use of protecting digital data, but they are examples of how encryption can work.

**Disclaimer** This code should not be used for encrypting sensitive data.  This project serves to implement code of various ciphers, some of which are pre-digital age methods.  For more information on more secure methods, users should look at something like AES-256 (https://www.nist.gov/publications/advanced-encryption-standard-aes). 

1) Vigenere_cipher.java
#This is a Java file, meaning that you will need to run 'javac Vigenere_cipher.java' to compile the code, and then you can run it.
